User Story : DLP Copy/Paste Testing

Title: Prevent unauthorized copy/paste of sensitive data

As a Security Tester
I want to test that Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies block or monitor copy/paste actions involving sensitive data
So that confidential information is not exfiltrated through clipboard operations

Acceptance Criteria

Copying sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, PII, source code) from a protected application must be blocked or logged.

Pasting sensitive data into unauthorized destinations (e.g., personal email, external chat apps) must be blocked and generate an alert.

All violations must generate alerts with details: user ID, application, timestamp, and data type.

Approved applications (e.g., internal CRM, ticketing system) must allow copy/paste without false positives.

Exceptions must be configurable for specific users or groups with business justification.

Non-Functional Requirements

Accuracy: Detection ≥ 95% with ≤ 3% false positives.

Performance: Blocking must occur in real time (< 500ms).

Compliance: Must align with organizational data classification and regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
